-- explicitly if `cmd` doesn't already open with a matching --class/
-- --app-id). `w`/`h` are the fraction of the monitor's usable area it's
-- centered and sized to when shown (default 0.6 each). Bound via the
-- "toggle-scratchpad" action below, name = <slot's name>.

-- the app itself asked for -- often the top-left corner, since plenty of
